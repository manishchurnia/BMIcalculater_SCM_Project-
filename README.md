Project Report: BMI, Nutrition, and Diet Recipe Website
________________________________________
1. Purpose of the Project
The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that helps users assess their Body Mass Index (BMI), gain knowledge about nutrition, and receive customized diet recipes. By combining BMI calculations, nutritional advice, and healthy meal suggestions, the web application serves as a comprehensive health tool aimed at improving user well-being.
The project aims to:
•	Calculate BMI: Allow users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI, determining whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
•	Provide Nutritional Information: Offer a user-friendly interface to display nutritional facts, focusing on promoting healthy eating habits.
•	Generate Diet Recipes: Suggest personalized diet recipes based on the user’s BMI and nutritional requirements, encouraging healthy meal planning.

2. Problem the Project Aims to Solve
Many people are unaware of the relationship between their weight, height, and overall health. Additionally, poor diet and lack of knowledge about nutrition often lead to unhealthy eating habits. This project aims to address these issues by:
•	Educating users about their health status through BMI calculation.
•	Providing easy-to-understand nutritional facts and meal suggestions tailored to their specific needs.
•	Encouraging healthier lifestyle choices through personalized diet plans and recipes.
The project aims to provide a simple and effective way for users to monitor their health and improve their eating habits, leading to better overall well-being.

3. Team Members and Responsibilities
This project was developed by three students, with each person handling a specific part of the web application. Below are the assigned roles:
•Manish (Front-end Development): Responsible for designing and developing the user interface of the web application using HTML and CSS. This student focused on creating an attractive, responsive layout for the BMI calculator, nutrition information, and recipe sections.
•	Manprabhnoor Kaur (JavaScript Logic): Responsible for implementing the BMI calculation logic using JavaScript. This student ensured that the application correctly calculated BMI based on the user's inputs and developed the logic for suggesting diet recipes based on the BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight).
•	Manu Sindhu (User Experience & Testing): Focused on ensuring the website was easy to use and intuitive. This student conducted user testing, gathered feedback, and ensured that all elements of the web application were functional and visually appealing.
