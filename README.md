1. Purpose of the Project
The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that helps users assess their Body Mass Index (BMI), gain knowledge about nutrition, and receive customized diet recipes. By combining BMI calculations, nutritional advice, and healthy meal suggestions, the web application serves as a comprehensive health tool aimed at improving user well-being.
The project aims to:
•	Calculate BMI: Allow users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI, determining whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
•	Provide Nutritional Information: Offer a user-friendly interface to display nutritional facts, focusing on promoting healthy eating habits.
•	Generate Diet Recipes: Suggest personalized diet recipes based on the user’s BMI and nutritional requirements, encouraging healthy meal planning.
